## Research Evolution

The publications show a clear research evolution:

1. **Problem Framing** (Accessibility definitions, measurement challenges)
2. **Theoretical Foundations** (Design spaces, capability models, hypertext critique)
3. **Model Development** (CISNA five-layer model, adaptation framework)
4. **Integration & Validation** (Complete framework, case studies, prototypes)

Many publications appear to be **conference submissions** that likely formed the basis for thesis chapters or were developed in parallel. The `w4a-blind` paper on CISNA seems to be a **conference-ready version** of the core model presented in the thesis.
