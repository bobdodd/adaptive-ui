Adaptation
The Respite Care Scenario
John, a mature student with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), is spending a week at a specialist respite care centre. It’s a busy week for him, and for the other residents. They have medical examinations with specialists in MS where their progress is reviewed, and their capabilities re-assessed. They have intensive, daily, physiotherapy sessions to help evaluate and improve their mobility using specially adapted video games. They have planned social events and outings, shopping, eating, and sightseeing.  Today they are in a pub, chatting, exchanging phone numbers, and in the process, comparing each others phones.
