User Personas as Capability Populations

These experimental personas were generated as part of the research effort for Chapter 4 of this thesis, considering how users of computer interfaces may be accurately expressed.


	•	Overview
The approach taken to testing and demonstration of  the capability model approach of Chapter 4, was to construct of  a small number of reasonably realistic user personas based on capability sets, designed to complement the Design Rationales used in Polymorphic Task Decomposition.
Two users are presented:  Mike Smith who has Multiple Sclerosis; and David Furness  who is profoundly deaf and is also colour-blind. These are abbreviated to MS and DF in the text. 
The most interesting of the two personas is MS, since Multiple Sclerosis is a complex progressive disease that can affect vision and mobility in a number of different ways, and users in the later stages of the disease are easily fatigued by activities that require concentration. The symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis also vary over time, even within a single day, and it is therefore possible to need multiple profiles for the same person, depending on whether they are having a good or a bad day.
The DF persona is yet another spiky profile. In this case it is a user who is profoundly deaf, and consequently relies heavily on the visual design space, but who also experiences colour-blindness, requiring that not only must audio cues and speech be presented visually, but using a restricted colour palette. As with the MS profile, this is a realistic user model as the number of people reported by Kovalev and Petrou (2005)  in the general population who experience some degree of colour blindness is as high as 8%.  
	•	Persona: Mike Smith (MS)
Mike is 45 years old British male with two children. His first and only language is English. He has experienced the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis for a number of years, with his vision and mobility progressively worsening. He has recently required the use an electrically powered wheelchair for mobility around his home, and an electric hoist to be lifted in and out of bed.  
Mike’s dexterity is poor with caused by kinaesthetic and tactile impairments. To touch a specific location requires him to visually guide his hand or finger to the target location. He has no feeling in his limbs and does not know if he is touching a surface without looking (or audio feedback) and is unaware of how hard he is pressing upon the surface. Consequently he finds the concentration required to use a computer system quite fatiguing.
Mike’s vision is generally poor, even when corrected by glasses, and he experiences some double/blurred vision. The degree of visual impairment is variable, and he has his good and his bad days. He finds closing one eye sometimes helps. On bad days, he finds the concentration needed to read a computer screen for mare than 15 minutes makes him fatigued. 
With fatigue comes an increase in hand tremors. The tremors change Mike’s ability to reliably touch a specific location, such as a key on a keyboard.
When Mike was assessed for assistive technology by the MS Society, he was assessed for voice activated input. However, it was found that Mike’s voice was quite weak, and that the number of errors made by the voice activation tools increased the longer Mike used the computer. So, it worked, but only for short periods.

sight
Whilst Mike does have stereo vision, he finds closing one eye helps him focus and read text.
focus
PARTIAL 
sight
Mike finds it difficult to focus, and can only do so for short periods of time without taking a rest.
focusDuration
Good day: 10 minutes Bad day:  2 minutes
focus
This depends on how fatigued Mike is, and how much he is concentrating. For example if he has to focus on the screen and then to the keyboard and back again, then a good day soon becomes a bad day.
tracking
PARTIAL 
focus
Mike can track an image, but the effort can fatigue him. His double vision makes it difficult to track a specific point on that image.
trackingDuration
Good day: 2 minutes Bad day: 0.5 minutes
tracking
On a good day, Mike can track an image (but not a point on the image) for 2 minutes plus, depending on how fatigues he is, and what other tasks he is performing. As he becomes fatigued that time drops.
viewRectangle
0, 0, 1024, 768
sight
The entire screen is viewable for Mike.
flicker
TRUE
sight
Flickering images are OK for Mike, although in poor lighting it can induce fatigue if used excessively.

readFontText
Mike’s ability to read text depends very much on the background noise and lighting conditions. Below 32 point on a high-contrast quiet background, 32 point is acceptable.  The result is that he can read small illuminated characters on a phone keyboard in some circumstances.

readFontText
Mike can read multiple columns, but in practice the effort involved in scrolling with multiple columns, and the effort in scanning for and finding the top of the next column or the bottom of the previous column induce fatigue. Hence the 1 column value.

	•	Persona: David Furness
David is 17 and has been profoundly deaf since birth. His first language is British Sign Language (BSL), although he can also read and write competently in English. David also suffers from protanopia, a form of colour-blindness that affects approximately 1% of the male population. Protanopia is caused by the lack of low-frequency receptors in the eyes, resulting in poor perception of red-based colours. In some cases, as in David’s, this results in the colour red being perceived as black/dark grey.
David’s spiky profile affects his leisure time, and his ability to interact socially with his friends. Particularly, he finds that he is at a disadvantage when playing computer games where ear-cons are used to identify off-screen activity, for example the approach of monsters in adventure games, and temporary changes in scoring rules. He also experiences problems with any games that use red-based colours on dark backgrounds, or “noisy” photo-realistic backgrounds where his colour blindness can make it difficult to identify details such as symbols on maps. Even a simple games such as Tetris is a problem on versions with a black background as one of the standard shapes, a long red rectangle is essentially invisible to him.
