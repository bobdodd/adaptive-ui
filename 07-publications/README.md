## Detailed Summaries

### 20yearsOn.doc
**Title:** 20 years On: The Dexter Model of Hypertext and its Impact on Web Accessibility
**Authors:** Robert Dodd
**Abstract:** Discusses the Dexter Model of Hypertext after 20 years, its limitations for accessibility, and proposes an extended view of hypertext for assistive technology needs.

### 923-RobertDodd.pdf
**Paper ID:** 923
**Note:** Title not extracted from PDF. Likely a conference submission with ID 923.

### A Vision of Future Accessible Mobile Technology.doc
**Title:** A Vision of Future Accessible Mobile Technology
**Content:** Vision paper discussing future directions for mobile accessibility.

### Accessibility Through Adaptation(1).doc
**Title:** Accessibility Through Adaptation
**Content:** Paper discussing definitions of accessibility, assessment scenarios, and the ontology of accessibility in context-dependent terms.

### User Capability in the Adaptive World.pdf
**Title:** User Capability in an Adaptive World
**Authors:** Robert Dodd, Dr. Steve Green, Dr. Elaine Pearson
**Abstract:** Discusses models of user capability, capacity, and preference for adaptive user experiences on mobile devices. Presents functional models that drive selection and configuration of interaction modalities.

### User Profiles for the Mobile World.doc
**Title:** User Capability in an Adaptive World (similar to PDF)
**Authors:** Robert Dodd, Dr. Steve Green, Dr. Elaine Pearson
**Abstract:** Similar to the PDF version, discussing user capability modeling for mobile devices.

### alt.doc
**Title:** Unknown (short document about alternative text)
**Content:** Likely discusses alternative text strategies for accessibility.

### atnac-4.doc
**Title:** Design for Accessible Handheld Devices
**Authors:** R. J. Dodd, Dr. E. Pearson, Dr. S.J. Green
**Conference:** ATNAC (Accessible Technology for Networked Applications Conference)
**Abstract:** Discusses accessibility of mobile devices, small form factors, and proposes a model for measuring user base breadth through user capability models and design spaces.

### hoc.doc / hoc(1).doc
**Title:** DO YOU HEAR WHAT I SEE? THE MULTI-SENSORY DESIGN SPACE IN ACCESSIBLE MOBILE DEVICES
**Authors:** R. J. Dodd
**Event:** Hands on Computing (HOC) workshop
**Content:** Workshop abstract discussing multi-sensory design spaces, mapping visual metaphors to sonic design spaces for users with impairments.

### w4a-blind.doc
**Title:** The CISNA Model of Accessible Adaptive Hypermedia
**Conference:** W4A (Web for All)
**Abstract:** Addresses problems with script-intensive web pages (AJAX) being opaque to screen readers. Proposes the CISNA five-layer document model (content, inventory, semantics, navigation, adaptation) as an extension of the Dexter Model. Includes a Google Maps fragment example.
